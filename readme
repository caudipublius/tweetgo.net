Quickstart

* Clone git repo
* Get a Twitter OAUTH API Key and Secret
* Create a file called oauth.config in the /mobile-twitter/ directory
** The file should be a single line containing your key and secret separated by a / -- for example
   MYKEY/MYSECRET
* Create a hosts file entry to point your API Key's domain to your local machine
* Run the project!

Production Deployments
* Create your own validation and decryption keys in the Web.config
* Update the SigningKey in CookieTempDataProvider.cs
* Create new IV and Salt in Encryptor.cs
* Create new SigningKey and EncryptingKey in AuthenticationService.cs
* Update AnalyticsHelper.cs with a GA account ID
* Create new Twitter API keys for the production deployment
* Create a folder for error logging (by default: c:\tweetgo-errors\)
